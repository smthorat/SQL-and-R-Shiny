## How to Use This App

Welcome to the scRNAseq Analysis Dashboard. This app allows users to upload, analyze, and visualize single-cell RNA sequencing data using Seurat objects. Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Uploading Your Data

- **Prepare Your Data**: Ensure that your data is saved as an `.rds` file format compatible with Seurat, such as a saved Seurat object.
- **Upload File**:
   - Navigate to the **scRNAseq Analyzer** tab in the sidebar.
   - Click on the **Upload File** button and select your `.rds` file from your device.
   - After the file is uploaded, the app will enable the **Run** button.

### 2. Running the Analysis

- Once the file has been uploaded:
   - Click the **Run** button to initiate the analysis.
   - The app will process the data, prepare UMAP visualizations, and create gene expression plots if applicable.
   - This process may take some time, depending on the size of the data and the analysis steps required.
   - Progress indicators will display the current status, and when the analysis is complete, new tabs with visualizations and options will appear.

### 3. Exploring the Results

After the analysis is complete, the following tabs may be available based on the data and selections:

- **UMAP Tab**:
   - This tab displays a UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) visualization of the single-cell data.
   - Use the **Metadata Column** dropdown menu to color the UMAP plot based on different cell attributes, such as gene expression levels or other metadata.

- **Gene Expression Tab**:
   - This tab provides a gene expression plot for specific genes within the dataset.
   - Select a gene of interest from the **Genes** dropdown menu to view its expression pattern across the dataset.

### 4. Downloading Plots

- **UMAP Plot**: 
   - You may download the UMAP visualization by clicking on the **Download UMAP** button within the UMAP tab.
   
- **Gene Expression Plot**:
   - In the Gene Expression tab, use the **Download Feature Plot** button to download the current gene expression plot.

### 5. Resetting the App

- To clear the uploaded file, reset all inputs, and remove generated tabs:
   - Press the **Reset** button located below the upload button.
   - This action will remove all plots, reset input fields, and allow you to upload a new file for a fresh analysis.
